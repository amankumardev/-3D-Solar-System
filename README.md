🌌 3D Solar System – HTML, CSS & JavaScript

A visually interactive 3D Solar System simulation built using HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript.
The project demonstrates smooth orbital animations, zooming, and speed control using lightweight JS logic.

🚀 Features

🌞 Glowing sun with gradient effects

🪐 All 8 planets orbiting in real-time

⚡ JavaScript controls:

Zoom In / Zoom Out

Speed Up / Slow Down

🎞️ Smooth CSS animations enhanced with JavaScript

🎨 Clean space-themed UI

💻 Lightweight code — no frameworks used

🧩 Tech Stack

HTML5 – Structure

CSS3 – Styles, animations, 3D transforms

JavaScript – Controls animation speed and zoom

🔧 How It Works
🌍 Planet Orbits

Each planet uses CSS @keyframes for circular rotation.
JavaScript dynamically updates animation duration to speed up or slow down orbits.

🔍 Zoom Control

JavaScript modifies CSS scale values to zoom in/out on the entire solar system container.

⚙️ Example JS Logic

document.querySelector(...) to access controls

Changing animation speed using style.animationDuration

Zoom using transform: scale()

🎯 Project Purpose

This project was created to learn and demonstrate:

How CSS animation can simulate orbital motion

How JavaScript can interactively modify animations

Creative front-end development using only web fundamentals

Building visually appealing simulations with minimal code

➕ Future Enhancements

Possible upgrades:

Add moons to planets

Add planet info pop-ups

Improve scaling using smooth transitions

Add real-time rotation of planets
